# 🎉 MAJOR PROGRESS: Vercel Build Almost Complete!

## ✅ Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Root Directory Fixed
- **Previous:** Vercel looking for files in non-existent `ide-web/` subdirectory
- **Fixed:** Now building from repository root (where all files actually are)
- **Evidence:** Successfully installing dependencies and detecting Next.js 15.3.5

### 2. ✅ Configuration Conflicts Resolved  
- **Previous:** `vercel.json` had conflicting `builds` and `functions` properties
- **Fixed:** Removed legacy `builds` property, kept modern `functions` configuration
- **Evidence:** No more Vercel configuration errors

### 3. ✅ Prisma Client Generation Fixed
- **Previous:** Prisma Client not generated during Vercel build process
- **Fixed:** Added `"postinstall": "prisma generate"` to package.json
- **Evidence:** This is the standard Vercel + Prisma solution
