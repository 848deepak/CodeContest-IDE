# URGENT: Vercel Configuration Fix Required

## 🚨 Issue Identified
Vercel is still trying to build from the `ide-web/` subdirectory, but all project files have been moved to the repository root.

## ✅ What's Already Done
- ✅ All project files moved to repository root
- ✅ package.json, next.config.ts, app/ directory are at root level
- ✅ Build passes locally: `npm run build` works perfectly
- ✅ All dependencies are correctly installed
- ✅ Latest code pushed to GitHub

## 🔧 Required Action: Update Vercel Project Settings

### Method 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your project: `CodeContest-IDE` or `codeunia-com`
3. Click on the project → Go to **Settings**
4. In **General** settings, find **Root Directory**
5. **CHANGE FROM:** `ide-web` **TO:** `.` (root directory)
6. Click **Save**
7. Go to **Deployments** tab and click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment

### Method 2: Delete and Reimport Project
1. Delete the current Vercel project
2. Import fresh from GitHub: `https://github.com/848deepak/CodeContest-IDE`
3. Ensure Root Directory is set to `.` (not `ide-web`)
4. Deploy

## 🎯 Expected Result
After fixing the root directory setting, Vercel should:
- ✅ Find `package.json` at root level
- ✅ Install dependencies correctly
- ✅ Build the Next.js project successfully
- ✅ Deploy to Codeunia.com

## 📋 Project Structure Verification
```
CodeContest-IDE/          ← Root (where Vercel should build)
├── package.json          ← Main package.json
├── next.config.ts        ← Next.js config
├── app/                  ← Next.js app directory
├── components/           ← React components
├── lib/                  ← Utilities
├── prisma/               ← Database schema
├── supabase/             ← Supabase config
└── vercel.json           ← Vercel config
```

## 🏁 Deployment Status
- **Code Status:** ✅ Production Ready
- **GitHub:** ✅ Latest Code Pushed
- **Vercel Config:** ❌ Needs Root Directory Fix
- **Domain:** ⏳ Pending Vercel Fix

Once the Vercel root directory is corrected, the deployment should succeed immediately.
