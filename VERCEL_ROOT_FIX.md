# Vercel Deployment Fix

This file was created to trigger a fresh deployment from the repository root.

## Issue
Vercel was previously configured to build from the `ide-web/` subdirectory, but we've moved all files to the repository root.

## Solution
- Ensure Vercel project settings point to the repository root (not ide-web/)
- All required files (package.json, next.config.ts, etc.) are now at the root level
- This commit should trigger a new deployment from the correct location

## Verification
- ✅ package.json at root
- ✅ next.config.ts at root  
- ✅ app/ directory at root
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Build passes locally
